"""Infrastructure module for the Miam application. Contains implementations of domain ports and database-related code. This module is responsible for interacting with external systems (e.g., databases) and should not contain any business logic. It serves as the "outer layer" in the hexagonal architecture, allowing the core domain to remain independent of specific technologies or frameworks."""
